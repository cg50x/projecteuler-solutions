# 10,0001st Prime

https://projecteuler.net/problem=7

## Description

The only way I can think of is to brute force this. Keep iterating through all natural numbers from 2 while collecting prime numbers as you see them. To test if a number is prime, just check if it is divisible by any prime numbers collected so far.

## How to Run

Run `node index.js`
