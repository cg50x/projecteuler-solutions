# Smallest Multiple

https://projecteuler.net/problem=5

## Description

To find the smallest multiple of a set of numbers, you need to look at the prime factors of those numbers because the smallest multiple will be the product of those prime factors. So to find the least common multiple, the solution iterates from numbers 1 to 20. For each number i from 1 to 20, the prime factors of i are calculated. After each
iteration, the largest amount of occurrences of each prime factor are recorded. At the end, the prime factors are multiplied together to get the smallest multiple
