# Sum Square Differences

https://projecteuler.net/problem=6

## Description

The key thing here is to notice that the square of the sum can be rewritten as (1*2) + ... + (2*1) + ... + (10*10) and that the sum of the squares is just a subset of the square of the sum. To solve the problem, you need to build a program that multiplies the numbers 1 to 100 with each other unless they're the same and adds them up.


## How to Run

Run `node index.js`
