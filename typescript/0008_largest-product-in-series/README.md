## Description

What a huge number! First, let's assume that the number is represented as an array of numbers, where each element in the array represents a digit. Also, the most significant digit comes first in the array. So the way to do this is to iterate through the array and keep multiplying 13 consecutive numbers as you go along the array while keeping track of the biggest product.
